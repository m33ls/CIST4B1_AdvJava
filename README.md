# Advanced Java Coursework
A repository to document my Java learning journey

## About Me
Hi, my name's Amelia, and my CS interests are mostly low-level programming and computer security related. I love writing about return-oriented programming and the fun things you can do with that (e.g. leaking memory, arbitrary code execution, and code golfing), but more generally just making computers do weird things they shouldn't be able to (because everything's a turing machine really). So I have lots of random bits and pieces of code on my [Github](https://github.com/m33ls), and as well as sometimes fun posts on my [blog](https://m33ls.github.io/).

## Goals
I just hope in this class that I'll improve and refresh my fundamentals, I'm not particularly in love with Java, but the underlying concepts are applicable everywhere.

So a few learning goals are:
* Deeper applications of object-oriented programming
* A deeper understanding of computer architectures, and data types and handling I'm less familiar with
* A better understanding of Java specifically and the way it abstracts ideas
* And, more confidence writing complex algorithms utilizing more advanced features / abstractions of Java

## Coursework
